## Prompt

I am building a RAG system for a robotics textbook.
Research the following:
1. Jina AI Free Embeddings: Best model for technical/scientific text (e.g. jina-embeddings-v2-base-en). How to use their API for free/rate limits?
2. Qdrant Cloud: Best practice for multi-chapter indexing. Should I use one collection with metadata filtering (per chapter) or separate collections?
3. Gemini 2.0 Flash via OpenAI Agent SDK: Review the provided reference (References/gemini_model.py) and identify the specific library required (likely 'openai-agents' or similar).
4. Docusaurus sidebars.js automation: Best way to dynamically generate the sidebar based on content/docs/ folder structure using JavaScript.

Provide a concise summary of findings for a research.md file.

## Response snapshot

Conducted comprehensive research on RAG system components including Jina AI embeddings, Qdrant indexing strategies, OpenAI Agents SDK for Gemini, and Docusaurus sidebar automation. Generated a detailed `research.md` file summarizing technical recommendations, API limits, and best practices.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Provided a solid technical foundation and architectural decisions for the RAG system and documentation site.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created /home/maaz/Desktop/Physical_and_Humanoid_Robotics_Book/research.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementing the indexing pipeline or setting up the Docusaurus site structure.
- 🧠 Reflection: Using autogenerated sidebars in Docusaurus and multitenancy in Qdrant significantly simplifies system maintenance.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial WebSearch calls failed with 404 errors, requiring fallback to WebFetch.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure WebSearch availability or prefer WebFetch for specific site queries.
