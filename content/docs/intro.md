# Introduction to Physical Robotics

Welcome to the foundation of modern robotics. This chapter explores the basics of building physical systems that interact with the world.

## Learning Objectives
- Define Physical Robotics.
- Understand the 3 laws of robotics in a modern context.
- Identify the components of a robotic system.

## Summary
Robotics is the intersection of mechanical engineering, electronics, and software. In this section, we use SI units (meters, radians, kilograms) to describe all system interactions.
