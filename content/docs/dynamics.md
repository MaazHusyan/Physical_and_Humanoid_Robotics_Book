# Dynamics and Control

Learn how to manage the forces and torques required to move humanoid robots effectively.

## Core Concepts
- Euler-Lagrange Equations.
- Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control.
- Model Predictive Control (MPC).

## Standards
Calculations leverage gravitational constant $g = 9.81 m/s^2$ and SI unit standards.
