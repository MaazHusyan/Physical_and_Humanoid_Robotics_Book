# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical and Humanoid Robotics Book Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: [specs/001-section-foundation/spec.md]

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Wait, I Mentioned Docusaurus/FastAPI because they are core requirements.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec uses Docusaurus and FastAPI as they were explicitly mandated in the project description and Constitution.
- All primary success criteria are defined for the foundation phase.
